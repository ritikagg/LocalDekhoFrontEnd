## Stack

### Front-End:

1. **React:** A JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces.

2. **React-Router:** This is used to handle the client-side routing in the app.

3. **Redux:** It is used for managing state of the React app.

4. **Redux-Thunk:** It is used to handle asynchronous actions in Redux.

### Testing:

1. **Jest:** It is a testing framework that comes preloaded with tools like task runner, assertion library, to execute different unit test cases.

2. **Enzyme:** It is basically used to create a simpler user interface for writing unit tests. As it doesn't have a test runner, thus it uses Jest to execute the tests.

### Logging:

1. **Sentry:** Sentry's React SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions. The SDK is a wrapper around @sentry/browser, with added functionality related to React. All methods available in @sentry/browser can be imported from @sentry/react.
